# Online Signature Tool

A web application that allows users to create and save digital signatures. Users can draw their signatures using a mouse or touchscreen, customize text color and background, and save the signature as an image file. This tool is useful for integrating digital signatures into web forms, contracts, or any application requiring a signature.
